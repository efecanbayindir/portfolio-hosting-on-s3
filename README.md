A simple static website hosted on AWS S3 as part of my Cloud Practitioner learning journey.


# 🪣 AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

This is my first cloud project using **Amazon S3** to host a static website.  
It’s part of my learning journey towards the **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certification.

### 🔧 What I did:
- Created an S3 bucket and configured it for static website hosting
- Uploaded a basic `index.html` file
- Set public access permissions and bucket policy
- Accessed the website through a public link
